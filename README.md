# Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

This project implements various machine learning models for breast cancer prediction using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset. The goal is to classify tumors as malignant or benign based on cell characteristics.

## üìå Project Overview

- Developed and evaluated three machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - XGBoost
- Achieved accuracy above 94% for all models
- Best performing model: Random Forest with 95.79% accuracy
- Comprehensive data preprocessing and feature selection

## üìä Results Summary

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC AUC |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression | 95.26%   | 95.87%    | 91.45% | 93.31%   | 99.19%  |
| Random Forest       | 95.79%   | 95.67%    | 93.33% | 94.21%   | 98.66%  |
| XGBoost             | 94.73%   | 93.70%    | 92.38% | 92.66%   | 98.97%  |
